# Quiz World

This is our semester project of the course "Human and Computer Interaction" of NTUA - 2022.

## Description

In this course our task was to develop an application that uses different capabilities of a mobile phone (sound, vibration, touch screen etc). We chose to develop an educational app in the form of a quiz game. For this project we created a Figma Prototype (that can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/iI4V0U3L4BWPAK8AAY4xcE/Quiz-World-Library?type=design&mode=design&t=cA0k8AZohWR3U6Jd-1)), and based on that we then developed the application on Flutter.

## Dependencies

- Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64).
- Flutter SDK [https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.3.7-stable.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.3.7-stable.zip).
- Android Studio - optional [https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.3.1.17/android-studio-2021.3.1.17-windows.exe](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.3.1.17/android-studio-2021.3.1.17-windows.exe).

## Start

To run the application open the project in VS Code and press 'Start Debugging' from 'Run' Menu in the Navigation Bar. From there you can choose a device to run it on to.

## Devices

You can always run the application on a browser (Chrome, Edge etc) and adjusting the window so that the height is bigger that=n the width (imitating a mobile phone screen), or creating a device emulator using Android Studio.

## Debug App

To build the debug app run `flutter build apk --debug` in the project directory. Then you can download the application to a mobile device and run it as an ordinary application.
